# AWSPenTestScripts

This will be a repo with a collection of scripts for AWS PenTesting

## enum_public_AMIs_Snapshots.py

This Script will take a list of AWS ownerIDs as input (need to update line 8 in the script) and checks if there are any public AMIs or Snapshots associated with those OwnerIDs
